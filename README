FC Readme

Welcome the FC, the development framework used by CurlyRocket.

First, some caveats:

FC builds on both iOS and OSX but has limited functionality depending on platform.
FC is very immature - pretty much everything is open to change, so don't build your livelyhood on it just yet.
FC is meant for both target executables and tools.
FC is written in Objective-C++ and works only on iOS and OSX. Don't expect a C++, Java or C# version - FC is not built to be cross platform.

TODO:

Document
Cean up old chuff that isn't needed - UIView stutt - it's a bit redundant or needs a nicer replacement
Better OSX support
Physics, actors etc etc...
Document resource format and intent
Unit tests
ARC support
etc.
