TODO:

(This stuff should really be tracked as issues on github)

Wrap UIView/NSView
Get rid of FCLuaClass - ugly

Reload Lua files - keep track of all loaded

Document - Doxygen - need a config
Cean up old chuff that isn't needed - UIView stuff - it's a bit redundant or needs a nicer replacement
Physics, actors etc etc...
Document resource format and intent
Unit tests
Optimisations - not even looked at this yet, although obvious problems shouldn't be present.
Add analytics to OSX build
etc.
